## Motivation
The purpose of this article is to layout the *various* **strategic dating consultant** services offered.

## A Note on Beta Services
Any service designated as *"beta"*, is a service that is in the process of being *"developed"* and does not require *monetary payment*. You can think of it as a *"free trial"*, where *qualified* applicants can apply by filling out the [contact form](https://thestrategyofdating.com/contact/). Bare in mind, while you are not required to pay for these services (assuming you *qualify*), you are required to consent to the terms of the [Beta Service Agreement](#beta-service-agreement).
