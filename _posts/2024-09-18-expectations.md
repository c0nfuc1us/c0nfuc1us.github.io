## Motivation
The purpose of this *article* is to clearly define what anyone we work with (e.g. *potential clients*) can expect from us, and what we *expect* from them. After reading this article, there should be **no doubt** what are the *boundaries* and *expectations* for both parties.

## Strategy NOT Therapy
As a **strategic dating consultant** my job is to help people who are **ready** to solve their problems, figure out what are the *optimal* **strategies** and corresponding **tactics** to their *"dating dilemma."* This is very very different from *therapy* and what **therapists** do. If it helps, you can think of me more as the *"father"* and the *therapist* more as the *"mother"*. You go to the mother to feel *safe*, *secure*, and *loved*. You go to the father when you want to actually learn how to **deal with reality** and the problems you will face.

Needless to say, if what you're looking for is *an emotional outlet* or any kind of *emotional support* you **will not** find that here: **do not contact us**.

## Professional Boundaries
As your **strategic dating consultant** we are not here to cultivate a *personal relationship* with you. By that, we mean we strictly maintain a **professional** relationship with you at **all times**. While we do want you to succeed in your *romantic endeavors*, and we genuinely wish the best for you, we cannot and will not deviate from our **strictly professional** relationship. You should remain *professional* at all times. This is a boundary that can **never** be crossed. As an example of what would be **unprofessional**: 

    do not ever ask us personal questions of any kind


We are not here to be interviewed by you, nor are we interested in engaging with you on a *personal* level. Any *failure* to *respect* this boundary **may** result in immediate *termination* of your service (and any necessary refund based on the refund policy for paid services), and *cessation* of further communication:

    you will be banned
