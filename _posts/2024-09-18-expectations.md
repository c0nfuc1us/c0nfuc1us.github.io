## Motivation
The purpose of this *article* is to clearly define what anyone I work with (e.g. *potential clients*) can expect from the provided services, and what I *expect* from them. After reading this article, there should be **no doubt** what are the *boundaries* and *expectations* for both parties.

## Strategy NOT Therapy
As a **strategic dating consultant** my job is to help people who are **ready** to solve their problems, figure out what are the *optimal* **strategies** and corresponding **tactics** to their *"dating dilemma."* This is very very different from *therapy* and what **therapists** do. If it helps, you can think of me more as the *"father"* and the *therapist* more as the *"mother"*. You go to the mother to feel *safe*, *secure*, and *loved*. You go to the father when you want to actually learn how to **deal with reality** and the problems you will face.

Needless to say, if what you're looking for is *an emotional outlet* or any kind of *emotional support* you **will not** find that here: **do not contact**.

## Professional Boundaries
As your **strategic dating consultant** I am not here to cultivate a *personal relationship* with you. By that, I mean I strictly maintain a **professional** relationship with you at **all times**. While I do want you to succeed in your *romantic endeavors*, and I genuinely wish the best for you, I cannot and will not deviate from our **strictly professional** relationship. You should remain *professional* at all times. This is a boundary that can **never** be crossed. As an example of what would be **unprofessional**: 

    do not ever ask us personal questions of any kind


I am not here to be interviewed by you, nor am I interested in engaging with you on a *personal* level. Any *failure* to *respect* this boundary will result in immediate *termination* of your service (and any necessary refund based on the refund policy for paid services), and *cessation* of further communication:

    you will be banned


## Credibility
For any and all *current* and *future* clients who want to know what *"qualifications"* I possess that justify the **strategic guidance** I offer, I would simply point you to any and all *content* that has been made available to the public. The **wisdom** and **counsel** I provide in this *content* (including *blog articles*, *social media posts*, etc) should be more than enough for you to know whether the provided services are sufficient for your needs. I **will not** under any circumstances provide *"additional qualifications."* If you *"feel"* as though I have not provided enough *"credentials"*, please seek *other service providers*: **do not contact**. And if you should raise your concerns, or dissatisfaction to me about my qualifications:

    you will be banned
