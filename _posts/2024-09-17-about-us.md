## The Problem
There is a general problem that I have come to understand about the modern world: it lacks **wisdom**. In fact, the only **real wisdom** that exists in the modern world, was written by the previous generations. This *lack of wisdom* affects **every** aspect of our lives, but I believe it is *most keenly felt* in the realm of *dating*, *love*, *sex*, and *romance* in general. Why? Because **everyone dates**. It is a **universal experience**. And yet, there is no **definitive** resource that addresses the *merciless* reality that is waiting in the **battlefield** that is dating. There simply is no guidance for the current (and future) generations, to help them make *wise decisions* in their *dating choices*.

## The Solution
In an attempt to *provide guidance* to the current (and future) generations, I launched this website. The ultimate goal of this website, and any services or content that I produce related to *the strategy of dating*, will serve as a stepping stone on the path to a singular destination: the definitive guide on *the strategy of dating*. Yes, this is an ambitious undertaking, but I do not think the *strategy* involved in dating is as complex or opaque as it may at first seem. The real challenge is making the *truth* and *wisdom* inherent in *successful* dating strategies and tactics **clear** and **concise**.
