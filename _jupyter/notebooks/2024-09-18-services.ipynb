You can think of it as a *\"free trial\"*, where *qualified* applicants can apply by filling out the [contact form](https://thestrategyofdating.com/contact/). Bare in mind, while you are not required to pay for these services (assuming you *qualify*), you are required to consent to the terms of the [Beta Service Agreement](#beta-service-agreement)."
